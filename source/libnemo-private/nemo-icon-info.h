/* A view's icon size is a number of pixels at a scale factor of 1. It used to
 * be one of seven named levels, which meant eight separate tables keyed by the
 * level and no way to ask for a size that was not on the list. The names
 * survive below only as the steps the slider marks, what Zoom In and Zoom Out
 * move between, and what an older settings file has to be read as.
 *
 * Icons are assumed to fit a square, though an individual image need not be
 * square and can be stretched, so this is a nominal size rather than a bound.
