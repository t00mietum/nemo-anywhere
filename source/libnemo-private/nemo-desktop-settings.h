/* A few settings are the desktop's to decide, not ours: which terminal to

 * a desktop publishes them we read its answer; everywhere else - Windows,
 * a bare WM, any non-Cinnamon session - our own value in settings.shcl
 * stands in. Read-only by design: this reports what the desktop wants, it
 * never writes back into somebody else's schema.

 * This is the only remaining GSettings user, and it never touches a schema
