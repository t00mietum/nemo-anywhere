/* Scaffolding for finding a removal that nothing else accounts for. Armed, it
 * asks before every trash and delete, whatever started it, and names the C
 * call site plus a backtrace so an unexpected caller can be read off the
 * dialog. The normal confirmations are off while it is armed, so nothing is
 * asked about twice.
 *
 * Two more ways a file stops being where it was, neither of which reaches the
 * delete path. A move takes the original away from its old location, and GIO
 * does that in one step with nothing to hook. An overwrite destroys whatever
 * was at the target, inside g_file_copy or g_file_move, with no call of ours
 * anywhere near it. Both ask here, and both name the two paths involved rather
 * than one list, since which side is being lost is the whole question.
 *
 * It sits at two levels. A job asks once, up front, for everything it is about
 * to take. Below that, the two functions that actually remove a file ask for
 * anything that got there without a job having asked - that is the half which
 * catches a path nobody knew about. The two are kept from doubling up by a
 * thread-local mark, since a job and the removals it drives run on one thread.
 * The overwrite ask ignores that mark: a job asks about its sources, never
 * about a target that happened to already exist.
 *
 * Three things can arm it, and the first one that speaks wins. The define
 * below only ever arms: at 1 every run of the build asks and neither of the
 * other two can take that back. At 0 the NEMO_TESTGUARD_ALL_DELETES
 * environment variable decides, either way, and with nothing there the
 * debug.testguard-all-deletes setting does.
 *
 * It compiles in whichever way the define is set, so a build already in use
 * can be armed without replacing it. Quiet, all it costs a delete is one
 * boolean read.
