/* blake3, 256 bits of it, which is what the file cache keys contents on.
 *
 * The algorithm was picked for speed rather than for anything cryptographic:
 * this runs while a folder is being listed, so a checksum that costs more than
 * reading the file is a checksum nobody can afford. It is vendored under
 * vendor/blake3 rather than linked, which is the other half of the reason -
 * see vendor/README.md.
 *
 * Nothing here decides when a checksum is worth computing. That is the caller's
 * call, and the answer is usually "only if the file was being read anyway".
