/* What stops a trash or delete from taking home with it, however the job came
 * about. The dialogs are one layer, and stray typing into a window that had just
 * come up got past them twice, so these rules sit where files are actually
 * removed. A path that never shows a dialog is held to them too.
 *
 * Home, any folder above it, and a folder where a drive or share is mounted are
 * never removed, and nothing walks into them. A tree removal never follows a
 * link to a folder. One job may not take most of what sits directly in home.
 * A delete key that arrives right after a window came up or took focus is
 * ignored, since that is typing meant for somewhere else.
