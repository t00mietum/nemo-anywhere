/* Three settings drive everything here: appearance.mode (system/light/dark),
 * appearance.gtk-theme and appearance.icon-theme. "system" defers to whatever
 * the platform reports - the Windows AppsUseLightTheme registry value, and on
 * a desktop that already told GTK, GTK's own answer - so it is a no-op where
 * the desktop is already in charge.
 *
 * Themes come from four places, searched user-first: the user's own drop-in
 * folder, the folder installed beside the app, the set compiled into the
 * binary, and whatever GTK already knows about. Each is offered to the picker
 * only for the backgrounds it was drawn for; see nemo_appearance_list_themes.
