/* Reached by running our own exe with --extensions-list, which is what the
 * plugin page in Preferences does. It is a separate process because reading an
 * extension's name means instantiating it, and a loaded module cannot be
 * unloaded again - the answer would otherwise cost the running app every
 * extension the user has switched off.
 *
 * Unix only. Nothing is loaded from disk on Windows.
