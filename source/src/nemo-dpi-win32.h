/* Windows only. The manifest declares us per-monitor DPI aware, which stops
 * Windows stretching the window as a bitmap on a scaled display - so from then
 * on the scaling is ours to do.
 *
 * GTK does most of it: it reads the awareness we declared, works out a scale
 * factor per monitor and draws at that. What it cannot do is a fraction - the
 * factor is a whole number, so a display at 125% or 150% is drawn at 100% and
 * everything on it comes out smaller than the windows beside it. Text is the
 * half of that we can fix: point sizes go through gtk-xft-dpi, which is not
 * restricted to whole steps, so setting it to the monitor's real DPI - with
 * the whole-number part the toolkit already applied divided back out - leaves
 * the type the size it should be. Widgets and icons stay on the whole step.
 *
 * Nothing here is needed anywhere else: X11 and Wayland desktops publish their
 * own scaling and GTK already follows it.
