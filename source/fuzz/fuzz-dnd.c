/* An x-special/gnome-icon-list payload arrives from whatever the drag came
 * from, which need not be a file manager and need not be friendly. The parser
 * has been off the end of this buffer before - see the guard-page test beside
 * it - so it is worth a real search rather than the handful of cases that test
 * can spell out.
 *
 * The NUL below is not padding. The no-geometry branch reads one byte past the
 * payload, where GtkSelectionData guarantees a terminator, so a harness that
 * left it out would report an overread the real caller cannot reach. */
