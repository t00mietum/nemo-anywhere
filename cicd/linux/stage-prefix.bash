##	- Purpose: Turn a finished Linux build into the relocatable prefix released
##	  as the release tarball - the unix half of the asset contract in design.md
##	  (one top-level folder, entry point bin/nemo-anywhere).
##	- Thin prefix by design: the GTK3 runtime is NOT bundled on Linux, it comes
##	  from the distro. Only nemo's own binaries, libs and data are here (~5MB).
##	- Runs INSIDE the build container (meson, glib-compile-schemas and
##	  gtk-update-icon-cache all have to be the ones the build used).
##	- One executable, at bin/nemo-anywhere, with no wrapper script in front of it.
##	  It points XDG_DATA_DIRS and PATH at its own folder on startup and finds the
##	  extension library through an $ORIGIN rpath, so the prefix runs from anywhere.
##	- Syntax: stage-prefix.bash <build-dir> <dest-dir>   (dest is wiped and rebuilt)
