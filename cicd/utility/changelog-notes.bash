##	- Purpose: Print one version's section of changelog.md, so a release can be
##	  published with the notes that were already written by hand rather than a
##	  machine-generated commit list.
##	- Output is the section body only: the "## v<version>" heading is dropped and
##	  the surrounding blank lines are trimmed, so it can go straight into
##	  `gh release create --notes-file`.
##	- Exits 1 with no output when that version has no section yet, which lets a
##	  caller fall back to generated notes instead of publishing an empty body.
##	- Version may be given with or without the leading v.
##	- Syntax: changelog-notes.bash <version> [changelog-path]
