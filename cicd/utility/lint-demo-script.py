##	- Purpose:
##		Static checks on the demo recorder. It drives the app through settings keys
##		and coordinates, and everything it gets wrong is silent: a renamed setting
##		just stops configuring anything, and a column that prints an account name
##		only shows up once the gif is published. Reading the file with ast keeps
##		this out of numpy, scipy and PIL, which the recorder itself needs.
##	- Syntax:
##		lint-demo-script.py [repo-root]
##	- History: At bottom of file.
