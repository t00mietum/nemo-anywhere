##	- Purpose: One answer to "what time is this build", so two builds of the same
##	  commit produce the same bytes. Everything that would otherwise stamp the
##	  clock reads SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH: the PE header the linker writes into the
##	  Windows exe, dpkg-deb, rpmbuild, and our own tar and zip.
##	- fSetSourceDate [repo-root] -> exports SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH from HEAD's commit
##	  date. Already set wins, so CI or a caller can pin it.
##	- fWarnIfSourceDateIsAGuess [repo-root] -> one warning line when the tree has
##	  changes HEAD does not describe. For the release lanes only.
##	- fPeTimestamp <file> -> the timestamp inside a PE image, for checking one.
##	- Syntax: source this file; it defines functions only.

## A dirty tree still gets HEAD's date - the alternative is the clock, which is

## warning would just be noise.

## The timestamp the linker wrote into a PE image, or nothing if the file is not
## one. Used to catch an artifact packed from a stale build. The python is flat on
## purpose: a <<- heredoc eats leading tabs, which would break any indented block.
